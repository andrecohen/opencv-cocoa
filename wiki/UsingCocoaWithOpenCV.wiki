= Introduction =

Cocoa is very strict about how it operates. This means there are some changes when using the HighGUI library with Cocoa. 

 # Your code must run from a secondary thread.
 # An Info.plist file must be added to your project.
 # Bundling your executable inside an application is preferable.

Aside from the above details it all works exactly the same way.

// Your actual code goes here
