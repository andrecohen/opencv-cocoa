= Introduction =

Cocoa is very strict about how it operates. This means there are some changes when using the HighGUI library with Cocoa. 

 # Your code must run from a secondary thread.
 # An Info.plist file must be added to your project. (Template found in the MacOSX-Cocoa example)
 # Bundling your executable inside an application is preferable.

Aside from the above details it all works exactly the same way.

= Skeleton of an OpenCV/Cocoa project = 

{{{
#include <opencv/cv.h>
#include <opencv/highgui.h>

int myCode(int argc, char *argv[]) {
// Your actual code goes here
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
return cvInitSystem(argc, argv, myCode);
}
}}}

= Working example = 

A working example can be found under /samples/MacOSX-Cocoa It is the adapted version of the original MacOSX example which does face tracking using data from the default computer camera.
